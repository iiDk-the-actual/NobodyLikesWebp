# NobodyLikesWebp

Nobody likes WebP files. They're completely unusable in mostly all software. Which is why I made a program that automatically converts WebP files to png files.
It fully converts all webp files in your downloads folder upon impact. It takes less than a second, and is completely invisible, letting you put it in your taskbar.
This program was made in a rush out of spite of the file format. It runs in your system tray, and can be closed with one right click. It also gives status updates on conversion.
Don't expect this to be maintained, I just hate Google.

To run it on startup, put the exe in shell:startup.
